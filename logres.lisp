(in-package :logres)

;;;; logres is a result logging tool for automating the storage and
;;;; retrieval of computed results via makeres.  Typical use is in
;;;; data analysis where there is a mountain of results needing to be
;;;; organized.
;;;;
;;;; Example: Tables & reductions: makeres can be told how to optimize
;;;; looping over tables, generating result tables along with any
;;;; other reductions according to the dependency graph.  Via macros,
;;;; operators can be defined which define logres entries for
;;;; reductions with ids created automatically via whatever convention
;;;; you wish (I like to use lists which denote the chain of
;;;; tables/filters/etc along with a reduction id).
