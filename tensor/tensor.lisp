;;;; A tensor is just a recursively structured sequence of sequences
;;;; of ....  It's just the generalization of the idea of a flat
;;;; sequence, and is useful for implementing things like contiguous
;;;; histograms, matrices, actual tensors, etc.
;;;;
;;;; To make use of the tensor functions, just define a list, or
;;;; vector of vectors, or even a list of vectors of lists of ..., you
;;;; get the idea.
;;;;
;;;; Of particular merit is the fact that everything is vectorized
;;;; automatically when using this library; you want to add a constant
;;;; value to a list?  Just do (+ (list x y z ...) value).  Want to
;;;; take the square root of an array of numbers?  Just do (sqrt
;;;; array).
