;;;; reusable-table.lisp

;;;; reusable-table provides a wrapper macro which, when given the
;;;; form you would have evaluated to open your table for reading,
;;;; creates a closure which will be called whenever the table needs
;;;; reloading.  The table object returned only defines minimal
;;;; interface, but this is a minor inconvenience as it is still
;;;; possible to access the raw table directly.
;;;;
;;;; It can safely be used with do-table since table-load-next-row
;;;; still returns nil when appropriate.
