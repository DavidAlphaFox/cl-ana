+ Unify makeres and logres into a single framework which would allow
  for target-wise loading/saving as well as batch load and save.  At
  present, the entire project gets loaded into memory, which I believe
  causes issues with my laptop (only has 2 GB memory).  It would be
  nice to be able to do analysis on machines with low memory as well.

  This will involve rewriting the res macro so that it checks to see
  if a result is loaded first, then either loads and returns or simply
  returns a result.

+ Edit projects in-place.  This is necessary if we allow single target
  load/save independently.  Make it easy to backup a project though
  for safety.  Version control is most likely infeasible due to the
  size of results.

+ Don't delete work directory every time we load/save, just delete
  content.

- Handle non-present parameters and targets by printing a warning
  instead of failing

- Save & load parameters as well.  May inspire improved parameter
  handling in makeres (e.g. remembering last settings if no new values
  are given and having a reset argument for restoring default
  parameter values).  This is critical since running makeres always
  recomputes everything if non-default parameter values were used.

- When loading parameters: Update last-param values to be the same as
  the loaded parameters in addition to setting the current parameter
  values (if applicable).

- It may even make sense to run (makeres <param values>) after loading
  everything so that any results unable to be stored can be
  recomputed; can make this optional behavior to be safe.

  I'm letting the user do this for now.

  It's an option that should be present once makeres, logres etc. are
  unified into a single framework.
