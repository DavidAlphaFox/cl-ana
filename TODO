logres:

* Work files should be tracked and have optional automatic path
  management.

* Logging functionality may need to be partially supported by graph
  transformations so that targets can be saved to disk and cleared
  from memory to avoid memory bottlenecks on low-memory systems.  It's
  already taking ~ 1.5 GB for my PhD analysis just to store all the
  histograms etc. in memory.

* Single function/macro for defining a makeres+logres project along
  with common settings.

makeres:

* Some way to control when and how transformations are loaded into the
  pipeline that doesn't require the user to know the exact ordering
  required.  As it stands, you have to know that e.g. macro
  transformations are required for table transformations, and that the
  transformed macros should be expanded prior to table
  transformations.
