;;;; makeres is a make-like tool for generating your analysis, i.e. it
;;;; uses a dependency graph to determine what to do in order to
;;;; generate any/all results you desire.  Why couldn't you just use
;;;; GNU make?  Well because for any non trivial work, you'll have to
;;;; specify a bit of how to do what you want, and furthermore since
;;;; the target is von Neumann architecture computers, you'll have to
;;;; provide some optimizations if you want to do things
;;;; declaratively and efficiently.
;;;;
;;;; makeres bridges the gap by allowing you to specify any number of
;;;; graph transformations to put in between the initial dependency
;;;; graph specification and the final
;;;; ready-for-literal-interpretation dependency graph.
;;;;
;;;; My initial (and still rather exemplary) usage concept was for
;;;; analyzing particle physics data.  This consisted of making
;;;; multiple passes over semilarge datasets, collecting various
;;;; results along the way.  The approach almost everyone uses
;;;; starting out is to
;;;;
;;;; * Do everything in a single pass over the entire dataset
;;;;
;;;; But this fails once you need information from the initial pass to
;;;; do something like filtering: you need a second pass.
;;;;
;;;; So this procedure results in either numbering your passes to keep
;;;; track of how many you have or trying to come up with memorable
;;;; names for each pass.  (If you want to get fancy, you can call it
;;;; a pipeline.)
;;;;
;;;; My work had escalated to the point of combining the two
;;;; approaches, having names with numerical suffixes denoting various
;;;; stages of the analysis, but always wondering if the distinctions
;;;; were really necessary.  I had formalized this system to a degree
;;;; that made me think a computer should be doing the work.
;;;;
;;;; Probably due to my experience with make, I found that viewing the
;;;; problem as a series of targets and dependencies made much more
;;;; sense than trying to keep up with passes over data.  I tried many
;;;; approaches in my head before settling on makeres.

;; computations for a graph with different parameters are placed in
;; the same graph.  Provide functions for copying graph to a new
;; graph-id to allow storage of different results.

;;;; There is one concern about recovering from errors.  As written,
;;;; the algorithm is: Generate final graph -> Compute final graph
;;;; results -> Copy results from final graph.  But, if any nodes in
;;;; the temp graph fail, then the final results may not be copied
;;;; properly.  This could be alleviated by providing a handler with
;;;; an option to copy completed results to the final graph.  This
;;;; would mean that the handler expression would need access to the
;;;; final graph object, but seems doable.
