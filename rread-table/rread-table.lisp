;;; An rread-table (Random-READ table) is a table that can be read
;;; from at random.  This doesn't guarantee that random reading is
;;; more efficient than sequential reading, but that it is possible.
;;;
;;; To be usable with the table generic functions table-get-field and
;;; table-load-next-row, simply define a method for
;;; rread-table-get-row-field.  The default way to run
;;; table-load-next-row is to just increment the current row index.
