;;; New operator: dotab, which is used to denote passing over a
;;; table (cl-ana table).  Define the operator as
;;;
;;; (dotab table inits return &body body)
;;;
;;; which places each binding in inits, executes body once per row
;;; using field selections from fields, and finally returning the
;;; return form outside the loop but inside the let expression.
;;;
;;; Rules:
;;;
;;; 1. Immediate dependents of the table which do not depend on
;;;    information from prior passes still needing acquisition should
;;;    be executed in parallel in a single pass over the table.
;;;
;;; 2. inits from these parallel targets should be merged, and any
;;;    common bindings only occur once.
;;;
;;; 3. As for any transformation, the resulting table must contain all
;;;    the initial targets.
;;;
;;; Approach is to create parallelized targets which return lists of
;;; all needed table-pass results.  The final targets are added as
;;; dependencies of these returned lists.  All other targets are left
;;; unchanged.  Status and values are copied from input target-table
;;; for applicable targets, and previous statuses and values for
;;; returned table are read if available.

;;; Must use one file per output table methodology since hdf5 datasets
;;; can't be modified (I think so, it didn't work in the past if I
;;; remember correctly) since some tables sharing a file may need to
;;; be written and read simulaneously.
;;;
;;; This frees up a possibility for file management: done inside table
;;; target expressions.  One of the table-pass bindings would be the
;;; file holding the table, and depending on the target status it
;;; could determine whether to open the file for reading or writing.
;;;
;;; The table return expression could be to first close the file, then
;;; re-open the file for reading.  *** Just found: h5fclose sets the
;;; file to be closed once all accessed contents are closed, so I can
;;; immediately close the file after getting the table object from
;;; inside, freeing the need to manage the file!
