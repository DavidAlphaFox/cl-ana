;;; Typespec: A typespec (as I'm referring to it) is either
;;;
;;; 1. A symbol denoting the cffi type
;;;
;;; 2. A list with the first element denoting the container type and
;;; the subsequent elements describing the members of the container
;;; type.
;;;
;;; Container types:
;;;
;;; :compound would denote that the type is a structure and the
;;; subsequent elements would be lists of the names and typespecs of
;;; the elements.  (This is just the symbol :compound consed onto an
;;; alist mapping names to typespecs.)
;;;
;;; :array would denote that the type is an array type.  The following
;;; elements in the typespec list are the typespec of the array
;;; elements, the rank of the array, and a list containing the size of
;;; the array along each dimension.  Note that multidimensional array
;;; typespecs need to be flattened if you intend to use
;;; convert-from-foreign.  The function flatten-array-typespec is
;;; provided for this purpose.
;;;
;;; Example 1: A structure with integer x and float y:
;;; (:compound ("x" . :int) ("y" . :float))
;;;
;;; Example 2: A 1-D array of 20 doubles:
;;; (:array :double 1 (20))
