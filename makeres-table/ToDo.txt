+ Automatically assign file names for physical table results.  This is
  possible at least for some table types, although it would require
  changing the save-target or load-target functions and tabletrans
  would need to assign file names.

  This would however break the generality of the table opener
  function, as it would need to assume e.g. the location of the
  pathname argument.  It's still possible to do, just requires extra
  rules.

- Found bug in csv-tables: Whenever a CSV physical table reduction is
  computed, the resulting CSV file has content.  However, after
  loading the CSV table with load-project and calling makeres, at some
  point the logged CSV table's file is emptied.
