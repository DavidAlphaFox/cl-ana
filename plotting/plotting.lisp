;;;; plotting.lisp

;;;; Interesting macro to use: with-output-to-string.  Use it to
;;;; create a string-stream object and write to it inside the body.
;;;; The resulting string is returned as the value.  This could be
;;;; extremely useful when generating the command sequences to send to
;;;; gnuplot.

;;;; Sequence of commands to generate a 2-d histogram plot in gnuplot
;;;; with the rainbow color pallete:
;;;;
;;;; set view map
;;;; set pm3d at b
;;;; set dgrid 100,100 # for a 100x100 histogram
;;;; set palette rgb 33,13,10 # you can get more options with command help palette rgbformulae
;;;; splot '-' with pm3d
;;;; <The data here should be given as four corners, not just the
;;;; center value.  A blank line should separate the left 2 corners
;;;; from the right corners, and two blank lines should separate each
;;;; bin.>
;;;; ...
;;;; e
;;;;
;;;; Note that you need to match the dgrid to the exact binning of the
;;;; histogram, and that this method is limited to uniformly-binned
;;;; histograms; you'll have to do more advanced things to handle
;;;; other cases.
;;;;
;;;; Also can do "splot ... title ''" to not have the annoying
;;;; title-legend.

;;;; Commands to do plotting with separate windows which have zoom etc.
;;;;
;;;; set term wxt <window-#> [options]
;;;; [plotting commands]...
;;;; set term wxt <other-window-#> [other options]
;;;; [other plotting commands]...
