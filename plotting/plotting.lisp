;;;; This library provides access to gnuplot from CL via
;;;; gnuplot-i-cffi, which in turn uses external-program.
;;;;
;;;; The structure of the classes follows gnuplot, with the exception
;;;; of the plot/graph distinction being seen as unnecessary.
;;;;
;;;; The structure is as follows:
;;;;
;;;; Page: The most basic thing which can be plotted upon.  Pages
;;;; contain some number of plots which are drawn on the page.
;;;;
;;;; Plot: A plot is either 2-D or 3-D, and defines the appropriate
;;;; axis.  A plot contains some number of lines which are drawn
;;;; together in the plot.
;;;;
;;;; Line: A line is a single function or collection of data which can
;;;; be plotted inside of a plot.
;;;;
;;;; The preferred approach to drawing is to use the draw, page,
;;;; plot2d/plot3d, and line functions to construct a plottable object
;;;; and then draw it.
;;;;
;;;; draw is the universal drawing function, it can plot a page, a
;;;; plot, or a line.  Additionally, since e.g. drawing a line
;;;; requires a page and plot to place it in, draw accepts arguments
;;;; for whatever plot objects must be generated as well.  (This does
;;;; mean there are multiple ways to use draw to draw the same thing,
;;;; but the freedom is nice).
;;;;
;;;; line is special in that it generates a line object from objects
;;;; of other types, e.g. (line #'sin) creates a line from sampling
;;;; #'sin and defaults the style to "lines".
;;;;
;;;; test.lisp demonstrates an example of using the full structure for
;;;; creating more complex plots; one can presumably define his own
;;;; functions for generating complex plots with certain conventions.
;;;; However I do intend to write a few convenience functions for
;;;; this, perhaps using plists to denote the structure of the
;;;; plotting objects.

(in-package :plotting)

;;;; I'm using a new strategy with gnuplot sessions: Each page gets
;;;; its own session; this way all windows stay interactive.  If the
;;;; memory footprint gets too big I'll have to do something about it,
;;;; but a suggestion to a similar concern was to use multiple
;;;; sessions so I'll see what happens.
