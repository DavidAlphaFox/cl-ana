;;;; This library provides access to gnuplot from CL via
;;;; gnuplot-i-cffi, which in turn uses gnuplot_i (see
;;;; gnuplot-i-cffi's files for appropriate copyright info).
;;;;
;;;; The structure of the classes follows gnuplot, with the exception
;;;; of the plot/graph distinction being seen as unnecessary.
;;;;
;;;; The structure is as follows:
;;;;
;;;; Page: The most basic thing which can be plotted upon.  Pages
;;;; contain some number of plots which are drawn on the page.
;;;;
;;;; Plot: A plot is either 2-D or 3-D, and defines the appropriate
;;;; axis.  A plot contains some number of lines which are drawn
;;;; together in the plot.
;;;;
;;;; Line: A line is a single function or collection of data which can
;;;; be plotted inside of a plot.
;;;;
;;;; There are a couple of convenience generic functions for plotting:
;;;; quick-draw and line.
;;;;
;;;; quick-draw is for quickly drawing some object in graphical form.
;;;;
;;;; line is for generating a line representing some object.
;;;;
;;;; quick-draw by the default method creates a 2-D plot using
;;;; line on the object, which means that in most cases all you
;;;; have to do is define a method of line for your type and you
;;;; can already use quick-draw.
;;;;
;;;; test.lisp demonstrates an example of using the full structure for
;;;; creating more complex plots; one can presumably define his own
;;;; functions for generating complex plots with certain conventions.
;;;; However I do intend to write a few convenience functions for
;;;; this, perhaps using plists to denote the structure of the
;;;; plotting objects.

(in-package :plotting)

;;;; I'm using a new strategy with gnuplot sessions: Each page gets
;;;; its own session; this way all windows stay interactive.  If the
;;;; memory footprint gets too big I'll have to do something about it,
;;;; but a suggestion to a similar concern was to use multiple
;;;; sessions so I'll see what happens.
