;;;; table.lisp

;;;; I've been thinking about the way I currently implement dotable,
;;;; and I may in fact change my mind to let the user explicitly state
;;;; which variables should be accessed inside the body of the loop.
;;;; The present method is a bit ugly in that it doesn't take into
;;;; account any lexical scoping issues which would shadow the
;;;; bindings of column variables.

;;;; Some thoughts on the even higher-level interface: I could create
;;;; a heterogeneous table type which would contain a list of row
;;;; blocks, each row block being a list of tables for the rows in the
;;;; block.  This allows me to extend a table by adding rows or
;;;; columns to an existing table.  The table-get-field could be
;;;; facilitated via 2 hash tables: one from row-index to column block
;;;; one from symbols to table index; from there just calling
;;;; table-get-field function after accessing the appropriate table
;;;; from the appropriate row block.

  "Macro for iterating over a table.

rowvar is a symbol which will be bound to the row number inside the
loop body.  You can optionally use a list (rowtype rowvar) which will
allow for the rowvar to have a type declared for it.

table is the table which will be looped upon.

To select specific columns from the table for reading, specify all the
desired column/field names in column-selections; if column-selections
is nil then all fields will be read.  Note that it is still more
efficient to specify all desired columns; for two column data this
results in about a 16% running time difference.  Also you must specify
either none or all of the desired columns to work with during the loop
body.

Each column-selection is a list of 1. column names to access during
the loop, by default the value will be bound to the lispified column
name as a symbol, 2. A list containing a symbol as the first element
and the column name as the second which will be bound to the symbol
given as the first element of the list.

The code body will be run for each row in the table.  If columns are
explicitly selected, then you can use declare statements at the
beginning of the loop body; otherwise this is not supported."
