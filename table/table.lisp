;;;; table.lisp

;;;; I've been thinking about the way I currently implement dotable,
;;;; and I may in fact change my mind to let the user explicitly state
;;;; which variables should be accessed inside the body of the loop.
;;;; The present method is a bit ugly in that it doesn't take into
;;;; account any lexical scoping issues which would shadow the
;;;; bindings of column variables.

;;;; Some thoughts on the even higher-level interface: I could create
;;;; a heterogeneous table type which would contain a list of row
;;;; blocks, each row block being a list of tables for the rows in the
;;;; block.  This allows me to extend a table by adding rows or
;;;; columns to an existing table.  The table-get-field could be
;;;; facilitated via 2 hash tables: one from row-index to column block
;;;; one from symbols to table index; from there just calling
;;;; table-get-field function after accessing the appropriate table
;;;; from the appropriate row block.
