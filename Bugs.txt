* Known bug with pass-collapse: table-push-fields inside an ltab is
  supposed to result in added lfields for the ultimate source table.
  Something is broken along these lines because the example in
  pass-collapse-test.lisp does not work.

  - Update: Apparently the *proj->tab->(ltab-)lfields* aren't being
    properly updated, they've all got nil mapped values even though
    there is clearly a push-fields inside of the filtered and filtered2
    ltab bodies.

  + New irritating result: The strategy of pushing all the lfields onto
    the source tables ends up clobbering the lfields from the other
    ltabs and possibly even the actual fields from the source table.
    Solution would be to generate gensyms for the lfields and replace
    the (field ...) in the immediately dependent reductions with (field
    gensym), the same technique used in e.g. pass-merge.

  * Current status: Still need to fix the irritating result, and
    additionally even though the ltab-lfields seem to be handled
    correctly by pass-collapse, there are still errors when run with
    makeres, which suggests that pass-merge is not handling the new
    ltab-lfields quite right.
