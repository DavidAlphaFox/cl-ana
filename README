cl-ana is a free (GPL) library of Common Lisp code for doing data
analysis; specifically it has to at least support what I'm doing right
now: analyzing particle accelerator event data.  It aims to be a
general purpose framework for analyzing small and large scale
datasets, including binned data analysis and visualization.  Much
effort has been made to ensure modularity so that individual
components may be used/re-used for a new purpose.

cl-ana is available via quicklisp (http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/);
for other dependencies see below.

Example code for using some of the functionality is contained in
various test.lisp files throughout the project; the full documentation
is located on the wiki page: http://github.com/ghollisjr/cl-ana/wiki

Whenever possible, features are implemented via generic functions so
that users can extend cl-ana to whatever they want to do.

So far the functionality this library provides includes:

* Tabulated data: Supports data tables read-from and written-to HDF5,
  ntuples, comma separated value (CSV) files, and plists for
  all-in-memory operation.  Adding a new table type is as easy as
  extending the table class and defining 4 functions for the table
  type.

* Histograms: Supports contiguous and sparse histograms of arbitrary
  dimensions.  Provides functional access to histograms via mapping
  (which allows reducing) and filtering.

* Nonlinear least squares fitting: Allows plain-old lisp functions to
  be fitted to data using the GNU Scientific Library (GSL); infers the
  number of fit parameters the function takes from the initial
  parameter guess.  Can fit against alists of data & histograms and is
  easily extended to allow fitting against other types by defining a
  single function for the new type.

* Plotting: Uses gnuplot to plot histograms, data samples, plain-old
  lisp functions, and strings interpreted as formulae.

* Generic math: Common Lisp doesn't provide user-extendable math
  functions; cl-ana provides its own versions of the basic math
  functions CL gives you but with the ability to extend them for
  whatever types you want.  Also provides use-gmath which easily adds
  generic-math's symbols to a package even if you already use the
  common-lisp package.  Already provided are extensions to the generic
  math functions for error propogation, quantities (values with
  units), and treating CL sequences as tensors with all the usual math
  functions being applied element-by-element in a MATLAB/GNU Octave
  fashion.

Also included are various utilities which have use in a variety of
places.

The main principles of the project are:

1. Conceptual clarity and documentation.  These are often neglected in
   software development, to the point where reading code can cause one
   to drink.  Conceptual clarity refers to the way in which code is
   written and the way in which algorithms are implemented: A slightly
   slower but easier to understand implementation is favored above a
   clusterfuck of bit shifts.  Documentation should always be provided
   for any feature along with example usages--ESPECIALLY with example
   usages, as these are sometimes more helpful than the actual
   documentation.

2. Modularity/Bottom-up design.  Whenever two components have a common
   feature/function/dependency, this commonality should be placed in a
   separate sublibrary.  To limit sublibrary number explosion, this
   should be done in conjunction with point 1 preserving conceptual
   clarity.  For example list utilities should be a sublibrary for
   general purpose list functions.  Further: If a feature can be
   provided by either a set of utility functions or a type heirarchy,
   strong preference should be given to the utility functions
   approach; i.e. one should have to argue long and hard before
   stratifying things into classes.

3. Lispyness.  Whenever possible, already established motifs from LISP
   programming practices should be used.  This goes for naming
   conventions, access macros, and the general desire to provide at
   least functional access to things.

Each sublibrary should go in its own directory and come with its own
.asdf file so that one can choose any subset of functionality to use
from the library.

As you will see in reading the code, I've tried to keep everything
well documented.  I place a high emphasis on documentation since I
know how easy it is to fall out of practice.  The last thing I want is
for the usual cargo-cult around old code to emerge.

Disclaimer: much of the code I've written has been part of my own
personal development as a LISP programmer; this is my first
non-trivial project with LISP, and coming from a C++ background I've
had to learn quite a few things along the way.  This means that there
may be some dark corners of the code which need help from more
experienced coders/myself at a later time.  In addition, I haven't
used any general testing framework.  (To be honest I haven't needed
one either as I've done the development in a highly bottom-up way,
testing everything as I write it.)  In short this is a work in
progress.

The code tries to be self documented, but I'm working on a
tutorial/user's guide on the github wiki page to explain how to use
the software to best effect.

The dependencies for this project are:

* HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)
* GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* CFFI (http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/)
* GSLL (http://common-lisp.net/projects/gsll/)
* Alexandria (http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/)
* iterate (http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/)
* antik (http://www.common-lisp.net/project/antik/)
* cl-csv (https://github.com/AccelerationNet/cl-csv)
* gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/)
* external-program (http://github.com/sellout/external-program)

All of the LISP dependencies can be installed via quicklisp
(http://www.quicklisp.org/).

I copied the API for using gnuplot from gnuplot_i
(http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/).  gnuplot_i was written by
N. Devillard <ndevilla@free.fr>, released to the public domain, and is
a no-nonsense gnuplot session manager written in C.

I use SBCL (http://www.sbcl.org/) almost exclusively; however, I also
intentionally try to ensure that all the code only assumes what the CL
standard provides.  Anytime implementation-specific functionality is
needed I try to use third party libraries for this.
