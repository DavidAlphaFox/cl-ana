;;;; generic-math.lisp

;;;; IMPORTANT NOTES
;;;;
;;;; To use the symbols from generic-math in your program, just place
;;;; (gmath:use-gmath <package-designator>) above your code to
;;;; shadowing-import gmath functions into the package you specify.
;;;; It's the best way I've come up with so far for easily replacing
;;;; the cl functions like +, -, ....  My usual routine is to place it
;;;; at the tail end of my package files since it has to do with the
;;;; package.
;;;; 
;;;; Note that you will have to use cl:... from this point on if you
;;;; want access to the shadowed symbols however.
;;;;
;;;; Also: Since common lisp defines the basic number class, but
;;;; doesn't give us a way to extend it: If you want to handle generic
;;;; scalar types in your program, one approach is to just define a
;;;; method for your function which is unspecialized on scalar type
;;;; arguments.  As long as the most basic operations are ultimately
;;;; scalar, this should work.
