(partially completed) Make lfields nicer.  table-pass, if used for the
  implementation, needs to have lfields arguments so that it can
  directly expand into executable code.  But: users should be able to
  safely define local lfields only used for a single table pass (and
  same for the inits).

- Fixed init bindings: pass-merge uses symbol-macrolets to bind inits
  so that each table-pass has its own private initialization bindings.

+ Still could fix the lfields to be the same
