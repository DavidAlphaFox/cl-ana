- Make lfields nicer.  table-pass, if used for the implementation,
  needs to have lfields arguments so that it can directly expand into
  executable code.  But: users should be able to safely define local
  lfields only used for a single table pass (and same for the inits).

- Fixed init bindings: pass-merge uses symbol-macrolets to bind inits
  so that each table-pass has its own private initialization bindings.

- Still could fix the lfields to be the same

+ Add pass collapsing for physical tables.

  * Algorithm: define collapse! for physical tables much like
    collapse! for logical tables.  The major difference is that
    collapse! for a given tab will need to group-by-pass (copy
    function from pass-merge) the various reductions of itself (first
    collapse tab reductions below the currently analyzed tab, just
    like the ltab collapse!) and then get the number of required
    passes for the source table.  Only for the passes which are
    present both for the source and the physical table should be
    collapsed from the physical table.
