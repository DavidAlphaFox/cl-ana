logres is a free (GPL) Common Lisp library/tool for logging results
computed with makeres (loading and storing).

Currently due to implementation-specific directory functionality and
cl-fad not working as it stands with SBCL, the only implementation
supported is SBCL.

Detailed information on the use of logres pending.
